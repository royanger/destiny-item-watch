## Contributing to the Project

### 1. Forking

If you want to contribute, please fork the `dev` branch and add your changes. All PRs should start as a fork of `dev` and not `main` or any other branch.

### 2. Sign the CLA

If you'd like to contribute something we'd be happy to have your contribution. We need you to "sign" a contributor license agreement (CLA) first that assigns us ownership so we are able to include it in this software. You can do this by adding your GitHub username to the `contributors.yml` file.
